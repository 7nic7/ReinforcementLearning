# ReinforcementLearning
  Implement multiple reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the random walk problem.Random walk problem is the agent can walk right or left in the road, and the far right of the road has a treasure. We want to teach the agent to find treasure as quickly as possible.
  In the folder named tabular_mrthods, there are these implemented algorithms,
- Dynamic Programing: Value Iteration
- Monte Carlo: first-visit MC(use epsilon-greedy policy)
- Temporal-Difference Learning: Q-learning, SARSA
